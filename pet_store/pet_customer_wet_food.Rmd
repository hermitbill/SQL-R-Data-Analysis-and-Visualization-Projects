## Objective 

Main task is to generate actionable insights from this pet food customer orders data set.
As a focus area, I to address the following questions:

* Which customers order and reorder the wet food, and when are they likely to try it?
* Are there certain characteristics of the pets, customers or their orders that impact how likely they are to purchase the wet food, and keep ordering it?
* Based on this data, what do you suggest we focus on to get more customers taking and continuing to enjoy our wet food?


## Data Source 
This data set is a selection of customers and their orders. This task was provided by Jahangir Raina on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jahangirraina/pet-food-customer-orders-online/tasks?taskId=2615).


The data is in wide format. There's no information on where the data came from or how it was collected.The data set has several missing entries. 



## Preparing and cleaning the data set
Load libraries
```{r}
#load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```



**Load data set**
```{r}
#load csv 
pet_food_customer <- read.csv("~/Downloads/pet_food_customer_orders.csv")
```



**Taking a look small into the data set**
```{r}
head(pet_food_customer)
```


**Format 'order_payment_date' dates and creating dates,weekdays and month/year columns**
```{r}
#format date and create weekday,month and year col
pet_food_customer$date <- as.Date(pet_food_customer$order_payment_date)
pet_food_customer$weekday <- wday(pet_food_customer$date,label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE)
pet_food_customer$month <- format(as.Date(pet_food_customer$date), "%y %m")
```



**Filtering wet pet food orders**
```{r}
#filter out 
customer_wet_food <- filter(pet_food_customer,pet_food_customer$wet_food_order_number > 1 )
#omit NA rows
customer_wet_food <- drop_na(customer_wet_food)
```

### Analysis 

**A quick analytic review of the data set**
```{r}
summary(customer_wet_food)
```



**The highest month of wet pet food orders**
```{r}
customer_wet_food %>%
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarise(num_of_order = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(num_of_order))

```



**The most popular food type tier **
```{r}
#food type
customer_wet_food %>% 
  group_by(pet_food_tier) %>% 
  summarise(num_of_order = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(num_of_order))
```



**How customers heard of the store and purchased wet pet food**
```{r}
customer_wet_food %>% 
  group_by(signup_promo) %>% 
  summarise(num = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(num))
  
```



**List of popular food flavors** 
```{r}
#pet food flavor
customer_wet_food %>% 
  group_by(pet_fav_flavour_list) %>% 
  summarise(num = n(),) %>% 
  filter(pet_fav_flavour_list != "") %>% 
  arrange(desc(num))
```




**The common health issue in pets that bought wet pet food**
```{r}
#health issues
customer_wet_food %>% 
  group_by(pet_health_issue_list) %>% 
  filter(pet_health_issue_list != "") %>% 
  summarise(num = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(num))
```



**The common allergies among pets that bought wet pet food**
```{r}
#pet allergies
customer_wet_food %>% 
  group_by(pet_allergen_list) %>% 
  filter(pet_allergen_list != "") %>% 
  summarise(num=n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(num))
```


## Visual 

**Gender of pets**
```{r}
customer_wet_food %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarise(num_of_order = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=1,y=num_of_order,fill=gender))+geom_bar(color="Black",stat = "identity",width = 1) + 
  coord_polar(theta = "y")+
  theme_void()+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```



```{r}
#weekday
customer_wet_food %>%
  group_by(weekday, customer_id) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=weekday)) + geom_bar(color="Black",fill="#4B9CD3")+
  labs(title = "Number of wet pet food orders per weekday in a year",x="Weekdays",y="Wet pet food orders")

#month/year
customer_wet_food %>%
  group_by(month, customer_id) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=month,)) + geom_bar(color="Black",fill="#4B9CD3")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))+
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Jan '19","Feb '20","Mar '19","Apr '19","May '19","Jun '19","Jul '19","Aug '19","Sep '19","Oct '19","Nov '19","Dec '19","Jan '20","Feb '20","Mar '20"))+

  group_by(pet_breed_size) %>% 
  summarise(num_of_order = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=pet_breed_size,y=num_of_order)) + geom_bar(color="Black",stat="identity",fill="#4B9CD3")+
  labs(title = "Pet breed size vs wet pet food orders", x="Pet breed size", y="Number of wet pet food orders")
